ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hdeg92

Iâ€™m relatively new to the data science field but have always been interested in learning how to build stories from the data I have at hand. At my current 
job I work with perinatal and maternal data to create quality reports for our member hospitals. There are so many things that can be done with this data 
but I'm not sure where to start.

Iâ€™m currently learning how to clean my code in R to make it easier to understand for other analysts in the company. I am also learning the basics of 
Tableau, SQL and Google Analytics.

My goal for the end of this year is to start converting a program we run for one of our reports from FoxPro to R. It's a big task but it's something
I really want to take on. I'm hoping to use this community to help with this conversion.
